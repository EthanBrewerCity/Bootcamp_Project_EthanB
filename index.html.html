      <h3>Ethan Brewer</h3>
      <p> Before coming to City Unversity of London, I had 5 years of coding experience with python, and during my 3 days work shadowing in year 12, i was able to gain some knowledge about Linux and Java with VSCode. My interests include cycling, socialising with friends, playing some tabletop games like dnd and warhammer and swimming. Throughout my secondary school and sixth form life, i used python to code in Computer Science GCSE and A level, in year 11 we made a basic game using pygame and in Sixth form I made a landmarks quiz game with a detective theme, the code functioned however we were unable to finish our porjects due to lockdown and COVID-19.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Bouncing Balls With Gravity</h3>
    <p>
	In my project during bootcamp, I have built a program which creates 2 bouncing balls which are affected by gravity and a dampening effect upon colliding with any walls or the other ball itself. In addition, the program shows the elapsed time that the program has been active, how many times each ball has collided with any wall and how many times the two balls have collided with eachother. This program uses PVectors for the positions, the speed and the gravity affecting the balls, it also uses if statements to register if the walls have been reached by the balls, and keyPressed to change the background of the program.
    <p>
